CS-320-T2644 Software Test Automation; QA 21EW2

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

During this course we used JUnit 5 as are testing methodology. JUnit 5 uses Java lambda which furture make our test stronger for testing our functions. Java Hashmap is another layer of functionality and security that ensured our code was safe to use and test against. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

The course followed a well-known and well received methodology named Agile. Albeit was not an Agile course you could tell that the curriculum was centered around the QA and testing aspects of Agile methodology. So with that said, we interpreted the user needs based on the information gathering technique I learned from my software development life cycle course. These two course were the perfect fit. Meaning, having an overall knowledge of the SDLC and then the details of the quality assurance and testing aspect ensured my interpretation of the user needs were up to industry standards.

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approached the design for the mobile solutions with a software engineer knowledge and methodologies used in contemporary times. The approach was from the perspective of an Agile quality assurance and testing engineer. So the approach is with a mindset of testing the functionality e.g., like creating a contact identification as an example. Hese is where we can create the ID, we can delete it, etc. Allow us to ensure the customer is getting the maximum from their mobile application.
